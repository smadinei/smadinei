### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Saman ...

ðŸŽ“ I am a PhD candidate in Industrial and Systems Engineering (Biomedical Minor) at Virginia Tech.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on modeling and evaluation of wearable assistive devices (exoskeletons) for use in manual material handling tasks.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to improve the design characteristics of exoskeletons using a human-centered design approach. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on clinical and occupational intervention advancements to improve human performance and life quality.
